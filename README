## Architecture

This project follows **MVVM + Clean Architecture** principles:

- **ViewModel**: Handles UI state and business logic
- **Repository / UseCases**: Handles data operations
- **Room DAO**: Local database for notes
- **Mapper**: Converts **data-layer entities** (`NoteEntity`) to **domain-layer models** (`Note`)
  Ensures the UI and business logic are decoupled from database implementation
- **Flow**: Reactive state updates ensure the UI automatically updates when data changes
